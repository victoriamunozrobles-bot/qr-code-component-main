## My process

The initial phase of this project involved a Figma-to-HTML conversion, where I conducted a thorough design analysis focusing on visual proportions, color palette, and typography. Since this is a straightforward static design implemented exclusively with HTML and CSS, the development lifecycle was completed efficiently.

The core implementation utilized Flexbox for precise element centering, strategic application of border-radius to achieve visual harmony and proportional rounding between the card container and its featured image, and @font-face to ensure reliable custom font integration. Furthermore, the layout is fully responsive, utilizing media queries at a 720-pixel breakpoint to optimize the presentation for mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This project served as a great opportunity to reinforce foundational CSS principles, specifically regarding visual consistency and responsive design structure. The two most significant areas of learning were the precise, proportional application of border-radius and a strategic, content-driven approach to media query breakpoints.

### Continued development

I would love to keep on learning responsive website desing and embark in bigger projects.
